# SummerTrainingProject2020 - Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering.

The project aims to form clusters using RFM scores for a wholesale company.

R : Recency - prefer low value

F : Frequency - prefer high value

M : Monetary - prefer high value


K-Means Clustering : Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm to form k (k = 1,2,3...) clusters based on distances from centroid.


To find the most optimal value of k, Elbow curve method is used.
